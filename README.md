## Summary

Paws Blog is a work-in-progress Ruby on Rails app I developed as an adaptation to the [Ruby on Rails Tutorial] (https://www.railstutorial.org) final app. Paws Blog strives to become the #1 Pet Lovers Blog in the world. Awwwwww.

Built with Ruby on Rails on the backend and Javascript and Bootstrap on the frontend.
