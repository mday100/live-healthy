## Summary

Live Healthy - Your Guide to Healthy Living is a demo health directory site. With news, nutrition, fitness, meditation, and a focus on natural remedies: Live Healthy is your one stop shop guide to healthy living! This site was one of the first static HTML pages I made according to an assigned [wireframe] (wire-frame.pdf).

Built with straight up HTML / CSS / CSS Animations on the frontend.

Hosted on GitHub Pages.
